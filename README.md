# Pok√©mon Red & Blue Gen1Style V5

**Why?**

This project started when I decided that I dislike the vanilla FireRed art style enough to create a sprite replacement hack.
This idea eventually grew through feature creep into a total re-de-make that aims to bring Red & Blue to the GBA, complete with widescreen and menus that don't suck!

**Why not play a colorization hack?**

The tiny screen of the GBC makes me sad, your view is very limited and menus are necessarily cramped. I wanted widescreen, I wanted the ability to connect to DS projects, I wanted good menus and full color.

**Is this yet another eternal beta?**

The current version is playable all the way through Cerulean Cave. It's 99% done.
Too many projects promised greatness then died due to disinterest, showed amazing work and then fizzled out.
I decided to develop G1S in secret until it was ready for the general public to play.
Currently, V5 is the latest stable version with the WIP V6 nearing completion.

**What's changed?**

Trainer parties, move stats, item prices and availability, learnsets, TMs, world layout, scripted events, dialogue, and more all match NTSC Red & Blue as closely as I can manage. I have played through the original games and G1S side-by-side 3 times in order to match the experience as closely as possible.

**Why the Progressing Hacks category?**

Although the project is 99% done, there are still some very important changes to be made
and more testing to be done before declaring the project fully finished. I cannot bring myself to declare the project properly finished until all audio and move animations are replaced.
