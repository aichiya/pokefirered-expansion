This is a disassembly of Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen, the purpose of this project is to replicate the majority of Red and Blue in a faithful and colored manner.

It builds the following ROMs:

* [**pokefirered.gba**]
* [**pokeleafgreen.gba**]
* [**pokefirered_rev1.gba**]

Completable from intro to Cerulean Cave.
Link trade script non-functional for now, battle seems to work.
